            <h2><canvas id='brush-icon-canvas' class="tool-icon-canvas" width="120" height="120"></canvas>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <em>YinYangPaint</em> is an HTML5 raster image editor.  It's current in beta, with the latest release<sup>1</sup> online at <a href="http://yinyangpaint.com">yinyangpaint.com</a>.
                To see what it is capable out, watch some of the <a href="#capabilities">expert user videos</a> below.
            </p>
            <p>
                  I suggest watching the videos, since YinYangPaint has been shown to have an indomitable learning curve, which is one issue that I can't realistically solve on my own.
                  The project needs help with some big user experience challenges.  It is huge challenge to convincing people to give YinYangPaint an shot at being their go-to Paint/Photoshop application.
            </p>
            <p>
                YinYangPaint is probably my best work of programming, and it has been dead for two years--in the project graveyard with no developers nor users.
                Of course my ego was wrapped up in this thing during initial development, but two years in the code graveyard changed my perspective.
                
                
                
                
                <!--I'm extremely proud of this thing, and while I was developing it, I felt a tremendous sense of ownership over the project.  It was my best work, and I wanted proper credit for the implementation I designed. -->
                
                
                <!--but I have nothing to gain from protectingno longer believe I have anything to gain from protecting my work here.-->
                </p>
                            <p>
                                My hope for the project is that some of you will download the source and become contributors.
                                Ultimately, I think that someone else will need to assume the development lead on the project if it is to become widely used.
                                
                                This is my first experience with open source development.  My plan for now is just to manage
                                
                                Assuming these words bring some contributors t writingI'll try to guide

                                </p>
                                
            <!--The beta is a complete functional editor.-->
                <p>
                You can try it for yourself   The current beta version has a steep learning curve, so I recommend watching the <i>expert</i> user videos below.
                </p>
            <p>
                The code was written over two years spanning 2012-2014, and has gone largely untouched for the last 2 years.  Today, YinYangPaint is back in active development, and I invite anyone interested to join in the development.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Let's make the online tool which everyone will use in favor of Paint or Photoshop.
             </p>
            
            <div class="splitter"></div>
            <h2><canvas id='eraser-icon-canvas' class="tool-icon-canvas" width="120" height="120"></canvas>The Code</h2>
            
            <p>It's a mess.  All globals</p>
            
            <div class="splitter"></div>
            <h2>Running the App</h2>
            <p>There's no backend.  The source code is all static files which can just be viewed in a web browser.</p>
            <p>You do still need to run some web server for the files, or else security errors will be thrown when using the canvas to read image data.</p>
            <p>I run the code locally by executing the command from the yinyangpaint directory:</p>
            <blockquote style="border-left:5px solid #1b3f6d;color:#1b3f6d;font-size:12px;font-family:Courier, monospace;padding-left:24px;padding-right:24px;">
                python -m SimpleHTTPServer
            </blockquote>
            <p>After which I can use the app in any browser at <i>localhost:8000</i>.  Literally any other server software will work.  It's truly takes a minute to clone the repo and serve the index.html file, so please do check it out if you are at all curious.</p>
            <div class="splitter"></div>
            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>You!  Web developers are the target audience right now.</p>
            <p>Of course, I hope for artists to actually choose to use YinYangPaint for general purposes, but in it's current state, it has not proven good enough for this.</p>
            <p>YinYangPaint is advanced enough however to get the attention of some web developers, so you guys reading this are the only users YinYangPaint will realisticly have in its current state.</p> 
             <div class="splitter"></div>
            <h2 id="capabilities"><canvas id='wand-icon-canvas' class="tool-icon-canvas" width="120" height="120"></canvas>Capabilities</h2>
            
            <p>The capabilities of the tool are solid.  It super smoothly handles some very complicated use cases.  Even on gigantic images, the canvas API seemlessly handles some insane computational tasks.  Long sequeces of drawing operations on giant images are executed many times over in the 1/60 of a second it takes the screen to refresh.  The implementation of HTML5 in modern browsers is really awesome.</p>
            
            <p>The UX is lacking, since users in the wild do not figure out how to use most of the advanced features correctly.</p>
            <p>I've recorded some videos showing me use YinYangPaint for some common use cases.  If you want an idea of what this code can do, I suggest browsing through these.</p>

            <p>The commentary is intended for programmers.  For the curious developer, these videos give an outline of how the app works. everything works under the hood, both because it's videos are Since I expect mostly developers to be watching (and I'm hoping to get some of you on board)

            <h2>Intended Users</h2>
            <p> I don't know exactly.  The original dream was to simply be the top HTML5 Image editor.  Users of all backgrounds might use YinYangPaint as their editor of choice, as many do with PhotoShop or MS Paint.</p>
            <p>This dream proved way too big for me persue as a side project.</p>
            <p></p>
            
            <p>
                YinYangPaint is an image editor built around the HTML canvas.  It is much more than merely a demo, but is evidently not complete enough to compete with commercial image editors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project's goal is to be <i>"good enough to use"</i>.  In the oversaturated market of image editing software, this is a real challenge.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Work on the project began in 2012, at which time all the popular in-browser image editors ran on Adobe Flash, not the HTML5 canvas.  ubiquitous browser support for the 2D canvas API was new,  
                
                t seems inevitable that an in-browser image editor will rise to join the most popular graphics software.  YinYangPaint is not that application, but it is still quite capable and I hope you might find it useful<br>
